Digital clock
=============

This resource pack contains a full, 24-hours format, real-time digital clock for Minecraft.
It differs from other attempts due to the fact that it also shows every single minute.
There are, in fact, 1441 different, generated clock faces.
It is compatible with resource pack format **`4`** (1.13+).

That's some resource pack brutality for you!
Enjoy!
